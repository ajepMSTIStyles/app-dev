# My Favorite Series

## Spongebob Squarepants
Throughout my childhood, this cartoon show is all my own craze. My tastes about favorite series will eventually change over time. Back then, however, this is a show that would inspire for the rest of my life.

## Various Anime
Spongebob aside, anime has also started to garner my own attention. In fact, such attention can be dated to my childhood as always. During that period, I would regularly watch the likes of Dragon Ball Z, Ghost Fighter, Knock Out, and many more. Eventually, as I grew up, my own horizons have started to expand.
